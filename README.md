# Python “Piscine” for Data Science (Bootcamp)

## Preamble
This repository contains the 42 School Python “Piscine” (Bootcamp) for Data Science. The exercises are designed to help you learn the fundamentals of Python and how to apply them in data science.

Each exercise includes its own tester (when applicable) and a README.md file explaining the exercise scope, what I learned, and my approach to solving it.
